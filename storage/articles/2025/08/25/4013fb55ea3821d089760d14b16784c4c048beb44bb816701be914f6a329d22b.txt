# John Worboys investigated over alleged 1990s rape

A new investigation into black cab rapist John Worboys is under way over an alleged sex attack in the 1990s, police have said.

The 68-year-old predator, now known as John Radford, was jailed indefinitely for public protection with a minimum term of eight years in 2009, after he was found guilty of 19 sex offences against 12 women between 2006 and 2008.

He was later jailed for life with a minimum term of six years at the Old Bailey in December 2019 after he admitted spiking the drinks of four women.

Lancashire Police has confirmed it is investigating an alleged rape more than 25 years ago in Blackpool, when Worboys worked as a stripper.

"We received a report of rape which was reported to have happened in the late 1990s in Blackpool," a spokesperson said.

"An investigation was launched, and our enquiries are ongoing.

"No one has been arrested at this stage."

Worboys, from Enfield, north London, became known as the black cab rapist after attacking victims in the city in his Hackney carriage.

Police previously said that they believe the former male stripper committed offences against more than 100 women before he was caught.

He received the life sentences after four victims came forward over a public outcry caused by a 2018 Parole Board ruling.

The board declared he was safe to be freed after serving 10 years.

That decision was later overturned by the High Court, leading to a review of the decision where the Parole Board decided Worboys must remain in jail.

Among the reasons given for refusing Worboys parole were his "sense of sexual entitlement" and a need to control women.

After the four women came forward, Worboys admitted two charges of administering a drug with intent to commit rape or indecent assault.

He also pleaded guilty to two further charges of administering a substance with intent to commit a sexual offence.
