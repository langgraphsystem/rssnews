# ScotRail to replace controversial AI voice on trains

ScotRail is set to replace a controversial AI voice on trains, after criticism from a professional voiceover artist.

Gayanne Potter's Scottish accent was used to teach station announcer "Iona", but she said it was a surprise to hear a "dreadful" robotic version of herself.

ScotRail introduced the voice in May, provide by Swedish tech firm ReadSpeaker, to replace pre-recorded human announcements on some services.

Transport Scotland said the rail operator now intended to introduce an alternative voice "as soon as practicable".

ScotRail has not confirmed if this will be a human recording or another AI-trained voice.

Ms Potter had urged ScotRail to scrap Iona and told BBC Scotland News that her voice was being used as an AI clone without her consent.

She said: "It's hard enough for people in the creative industry to sustain careers, but to be competing with a robotic version of yourself adds insult to injury."

Some passengers had also criticised the voice, writing on social media that it sounded "weird" and "unnatural".

ScotRail previously said it had no plans to replace Iona and said passengers would get used to it over time.

But as reported by the Mail on Sunday, Transport Scotland said ScotRail was now working to replace Iona.

A spokesperson said: "This issue was raised directly with ministers, both in correspondence and in parliament.

"Our understanding is that ScotRail is working to make changes to the system, and this includes implementing an alternative 'voice' as soon as practicable.

"As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, Scotland remains committed to leading AI development in a way that is ethical, inclusive, and trustworthy."

Gayanne Potter has been involved in an ongoing dispute with ReadSpeaker over her voice recording work for Iona.

ReadSpeaker's technology uses AI learning to emulate an accent or language from recordings.

Using a text-to-speech system, users can type anything and Iona will speak it out loud in a Scottish accent.

Iona is depicted in marketing imagery as a red haired woman in a Scottish landscape.

Ms Potter said she provided recordings in 2021, but believed it would be used for accessibility and e-learning software rather than wider commercial purposes.

Readspeaker said it was aware of her concerns and had "comprehensively addressed these with Ms Potter's legal representative several times in the past".

After the BBC published the story in May, Ms Potter asked ScotRail to remove the Iona announcements.

She said: "After the years that I've gone through to try to have my data removed - it's still being used.

"They don't realise it's actually a real person who's been put through a dreadful voice app."

Trade union Equity, which represents creative industry workers, has said growing adoption of AI technology was "a real concern".

ScotRail declined to give details on when the voice would be removed, but said it was "continuing to work with ReadSpeaker on the matter".

A spokesperson added: "While there is no update at present, we do expect to be able to provide a further update in the coming weeks."
